## Garden of Eve - March 2024
In my proposal to a web development client, I made an interactive prototype on Figma of the redesigned website's new home page. The prototype includes interactive components and was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind.

<p style="margin-top: 16px;"> In addition to the prototype, I also made a pitch deck which included assets such as a proposed color palette as well as critiques of the current site. In the example critique slide shown below, I explain how the sidebar not only contains extraneous content, it also obstructs the visual hierarchy by taking away from the main content on every page.</p>

## Bridge - June 2023
My DGT HUM 110: User Experience and Design course was structured around a semester-long design project in which we iterated on a design idea surrounding the theme of family. I came up with the idea of an instant-translation messaging app to bridge inter-generational language barriers— aptly named Bridge. I performed heuristic evaluations and usability testing on competitors, delved into UX storytelling to better understand the end users, and created wireframes. More detail on the entire project can be found [here](https://carliehuang.github.io/DH110/).

## Groundcycle - August 2022
I had the incredible opportunity to build sustainability intiative [Groundcycle](https://groundcycle.org/)'s web app from the ground up. This included the front-facing website, user system, and delivery system still in use by thousands of users today. I carefully considered the context that Groundcycle obtains many customers via social media that users liekly access on their phones, so all pages were designed with inter-device compatibility in mind. The site is also laid out in the way modern users have come to expect— menu hierarchy, portal access— in order to promote a low learning curve for users.
