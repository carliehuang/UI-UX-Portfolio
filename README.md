## Garden of Eve - March 2024
In my proposal to a web development client, I made an interactive prototype on Figma of the redesigned website's new home page. The prototype, embedded below, includes interactive components and was designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind.

<p style="margin-top: 16px;"> In addition to the prototype, I also made a pitch deck which included assets such as a proposed color palette as well as a critique of the current site. In the example critique slide shown below, I explain how the sidebar not only contains extraneous content, it also obstructs the visual hierarchy and therefore detracts from the main content on every page.</p>

## Bridge - June 2023
My DGT HUM 110: User Experience and Design course was structured around a semester-long design project in which we iterated on a design idea surrounding the theme of family. I came up with the idea of an instant-translation messaging app to bridge inter-generational language barriersâ€” aptly named Bridge. I performed heuristic evaluations and usability testing on competitors, delved into UX storytelling to better understand the end users, and created wireframes and prototypes. Some of my work is shown below, and more detail on the entire project can be found [here](https://carliehuang.github.io/DH110/).

## Groundcycle - August 2022
I had the incredible opportunity to build sustainability intiative [Groundcycle](https://groundcycle.org/)'s web app from the ground up. This included the front-facing website, user system, and delivery system still in use by thousands of users today. Responsive, cross-platform design was a priority in all pages because Groundcycle drives much of its traffic through social media, which users likely access on their phones. The site also utilizes the standard hierarchical structure of a modern website in order to promote a low learning curve for users.
